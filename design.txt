1. Load previous data
2. Check current conditions
3. If current condition != previous data
  3.1. If previous data does not have a 'deviation time', set a deviation time, and bail.
  3.2. If previous data HAS a 'deviation time', check if 'deviation time' <= Max deviation duration
    3.2.1.  If before deviation expiration, bail.
    3.2.2.  If after deviation expiration, clear deviation setting, and continue
3. Determine what we should do based on current conditions.
